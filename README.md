# dcouch, an Alternative to Mnesia with Unique Features

**WIP**, code will be available on 2014-03-28.

At the Erlang Factory SF BAY AREA 2014, I gave a quick lightning talk
introducing opencouch a document oriented database compatible with
Apache CouchDB that you can embed in your Erlang Application. The main
goal of opencouch is to propose a viable alternative to mnesia while
adding some key features of Apache CouchDB like the master-master
replication or new features like the horizontal scalability and multiple
storage backends. The feedback was really encouraging and I decided to
go further. Opencouch now named "dcouch" is one of the core component of
the refuge project.

For the initial version look at http://github.com/benoitc/opencouch.
